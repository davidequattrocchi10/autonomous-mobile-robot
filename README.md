# Autonomous Mobile Robot Navigation System

🤖 A comprehensive AGV/AMR navigation system featuring multiple path planning algorithms, reinforcement learning, and dynamic obstacle avoidance.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a complete autonomous navigation system for mobile robots (AGV/AMR) in warehouse and manufacturing environments. It compares classical planning algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*, RRT) with reinforcement learning approaches, and includes realistic considerations like sensor noise, battery consumption, and dynamic obstacles.

## ✨ Features

- **Multiple Planning Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, A*, RRT
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-Learning with adaptive behavior
- **Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance**: DWA (Dynamic Window Approach)
- **Sensor Simulation**: LIDAR, IMU with realistic noise models
- **Control Systems**: Path following, PID control
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare algorithms across scenarios
- **Interactive Visualizations**: See the robot in action
